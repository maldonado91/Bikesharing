# Bikesharing

### 1. Overview of Project:
#### We want to develop an analysis for a Des Moines Citi Bike business so we can present it to investors. We have a starting point in Tableau using NYC data and now we want to create a well designed story for our presentation. 

### 2. Results:

* We want to look customer/subscriber breakdown for Citi Bike.

* We want to look at the general trip durations. While most are within an hour we wanted to expand to 3 hours to see the data. The majority of trips are done within 5 minutes.

    ![filter](https://github.com/maldonado91/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.PNG)    
* Much like the visual above, we want to look at trip duration but this time with gender as a filter breakdown. Males have the largest usage.

* Since we are only looking at Agust, here is the most popular hour of bike usage. The 17th hour (or 5PM) is most popular.

* We want o look at how users decide on which times to use bike sand based on the heatmap, users choose morning and afternoon commute times for work. Outside of the, it's fairly even across the weekedn sunlight hours.

* Again, much like the visual above, we wanted to look at gender to get a better idea if these groups chose different usage times. It appears to be the same for both male and female.

* Lastly, we added a visual to look at usertyes and gender by day of the week. Males on thursday have a very high usage rate.


 
### 3. Summary:
#### There is a clear distinction between between male and females when it comes to bikes and we also noticed some interesting trends on bike usage in relation to the hour of the day. Bikes have a played a huge role for those getting to and from work in the weekdays. 

#### Two areas I'd like to revist are 
  1) Age of riders
  2) Start/ending stations
